## Unreleased

- Match the measured iOS 27 interaction motion: tab pills lift into a glass
  lens with bar and icon scaling, glide on touch, chase the finger through a
  spring and stretch with speed; buttons use the native press and release
  springs and glow timing. `GlassMotion` gains press and release bounce fields.
- Remove the native plugin, platform views, and rendering-mode API.
- Calibrate regular material colors against SwiftUI and share foreground/selection defaults across platforms.

- Fix the fallback circle border in non-square layouts.
- Simplify renderer dispatch and batch grouping without changing the public API.
- Document the research, source projects, and rendering limitations in the README.

## 0.1.0

- Introduce LiquidPrism surfaces, glass buttons, and controlled spring tab bars.
- Support Flutter-rendered Liquid Glass with customizable Impeller optics.
- Add app-wide appearance, tint, foreground, motion, and shape configuration.
- Support custom tab icons, optional labels, finger tracking, and independent pill blur.
- Include mobile example, regression tests, and CI build checks.
